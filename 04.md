On the ability to memorize and on the way our thinking becomes more and more dogmatic over time as a contributing factor of our notion of time. On the self-enforcement of deterministic subsystems, due to mental images and goals which are mistaken for the actual world.
===

Practicioners of mnemonics have long realised that the easiest way to learn a bunch of unconnected pieces of information is to make up some connections between them. This is because our brain is very bad at capturing raw perception data and very good in capturing mental images and causal connections - we only remember events that are connected with one another.

And because we see them as connected, all events that we remember form a structure that is known as a causal chain. An event that has nothing to do with our causal chain is simply not perceived by us (or, it is perceived but not remembered even for a second). So in many ways, placing the event in the causal chain is perception itself.

Furthermore events that are part of the causal chain can be compressed further, by imposing additional structure - e.g. if I just remember that I went to school yesterday, I don't have to remember going out of the house, locking the door, waiting for the bus etc as all this is impricit (some computer compression alghorithms are based on the same principle, by the way). The more time passes and the more compressed our memories are, the more stylized they become, replacing more and more perception data with mental images. This is why older people as a rule are more dogmatic than younger ones. It is not about older people having more knowledge (real knowledge will make you less dogmatic if anything), it's about having more dogmas.

0. Because of the way that memories work, mental images have the power to reinforce themselves with time - having the image of `A â‡’  B` in our head, we would see `A`-s and `B`-s all over the place.

This is why, in our everyday thinking, we often refer to all things that we talk about as either real or unreal (just like in logic we split statements to true and false) e.g. Stephen Hawking is real and Professor Charles Francis Xavier is not - an event is either in the chain or not.

This line of thought, however is too naive. To see why, one just has to look at a more abstract concept, e.g. is true love real, and does it exist? It all depends on how you define it, and defining it in too robust terms is impossible, as the definition would rely on many other concepts.

the "realness" of a concept is not just a matter of whether something exist or does not you had or had not seen something which resembles it, but a matter of how much does the concept resonate with the concepts that constitute our worldview. In other words, it is not a yes/no question. The degree of realness, we can also call the degree of *anticipation of perception*, as Kant calls it. i.e. considering an object real means that you anticipate to sense it. Although it seems counter intuitive at first, the anticipation of perseption actually comes *before the perception* - only after we are ready to and prepared to perceive something, we may actually come to realise that it is actually there.
