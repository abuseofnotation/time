# Dogmatism Through the Lens of Memory: The Unreliability of Past Events in Shaping Our Worldview

_On the Ability to Memorize and How Our Thinking Becomes More Dogmatic Over Time Due to Mental Images and Goals Mistaken for the Actual World_

Practitioners of mnemonics have long understood that the easiest way to remember a collection of unconnected pieces of information is to just make up some connections between them. This is because our brains cannot capture raw perception data --- they can only capture mental images and causal connections i.e. we only remember events that are connected with one another.

> 0.  Because we necessarily see them as connected, all events that we remember form a structure known as a causal chain.

An event that has nothing to do with our causal chain is simply not perceived by us (or, if perceived, it is not remembered even for a second). In many ways, placing the event in the causal chain is perception itself.

However, since we humans have only one causal chain — that is, we do not have multiple ways to perceive a given collection of events that we can switch between, putting an event on the causal chain also means replacing it with a mental image.

> 1.  Due to the way memories work, mental images reinforce themselves over time --- having the image of `A ⇒ B` in our minds, we would see `A`-s and `B`-s all over the place.

One of the biggest biases in our perception of time, which we have already discussed, is our inability to differentiate between the mental images representing the world (`M`) and the world itself (`W`). This results in us thinking that our perceptions represent the state of affairs, whereas they are merely a record of our mental images. Memories are probably the chief reason for this bias, as they can multiply it indefinitely: the moment we perceive a given "frame," the memory of it is rich in sensory (empirical) data, which can be further analyzed and interpreted. But as soon as we perceive the next frame, many aspects of the previous one are compressed, leaving only those that provide context for the next frame. Then, when a third frame is perceived, the two we already have are packaged together again, leaving only the aspects useful for the perception of the third frame. The problem is that _there isn't a way to know which aspects will actually be useful for providing context in the future_.

Like causality, we naively think of our memories as true representations of reality because they "work," i.e. because they have a good success rate at predicting future events. However, as with any other mental image, we do not have a clear criterion for what it means for memories to "work". Like any other mental image, memories represent an interpretation of reality, but they are also immutable. Once an event in the past is categorized under a mental image, let's say `A`, it cannot be taken to mean anything else than `A`, even if we start using better and more accurate mental images for such events in the future.

> 2.  The interpretation of past events cannot be modified, and different interpretations cannot be compared with one another, as the raw perceptive data is lost when details of the event are forgotten. If we experience an event that we label `A` at time `T1`, and then later, at time `T2`, we "upgrade" our understanding and categorize the same class of events under a new related mental image — `A'`. (We can think of `A'` as better and more accurate, although whether it is so is actually irrelevant for our example.) Although this upgrade in our worldview would affect all future events, it would not change how the event experienced at time `T1` is categorized — it will still be `A`. Because sensory data is lost, there would be no way for us to know whether it was actually `A'` or not.

In other words, past events that we remember are mere projections of the mental images we used at that instant. They are as unstable, and as subject to change, as our future projections.

Furthermore, events that are part of the causal chain are compressed further by imposing additional structure over time. For example, if I remember that I went to school yesterday, I do not remember going out of the house, locking the door, waiting for the bus, etc., as all of this is implicit. (Some computer compression algorithms are based on the same principle.) This compression process repeats more and more as our memories age. For instance, in ten years, you wouldn't remember every way you spent at school, you'd just have a very abstract image of the time you spent there. However, this compression algorithm is "lossy" — meaning that over time, our memories become more and more abstract and we remember less and less of what really happened in the form of actual events and more in the form of abstract mental images. This is a process that is sometimes called "stylization" (a term from visual arts): an image is non-stylized when it reflects perception data (e.g. a photorealistic painting) and stylized when it reflects ideas (e.g. a road sign). 

> 3. Stylization works in the following way:
1. We _recall_ an event or a chain of events from our memory.
2. We _interpret_ it.
3. We save the interpretation in the memory in the place of the memory 

Actually that's not an entrirely correct way to put it, because the memory was an interpretation before, just less stylized, memories are interpretations of interpretations of interpretations.

The more distant an event is, the more abstract and "stylized" it becomes, i.e., it is more connected with the mental images we used when we perceived it. Because of this, we cannot use our memories to create any _new_ mental images, only to extrapolate on the images we already have. This is why older people tend to be more dogmatic than younger people—we accumulate more mental images with time and, therefore, perceive less. The only way to prevent this is to have no memories at all.

## The Default Interpretation

Memories are a very unreliable source for understanding reality, unreliability that we should take into account when making any conclusions based on them, but, as we shall see here, our normal stance is not like this, as many of these images are deeply embedded in our minds.

Every set of events allows for many interpretations, interpretation being a simplification that enables us to process them easier, and to store them in our brain. A valuable skill, that I discuss here, is the skill to "switch" between interpretations, i.e. to see a given set of events in a different way, for example, to see that a given activity that we previously perceived as benefitial to us, is actually harmful, or even to see ourselves in a new light. In fact, this skill is a prerequisite of all innovative ideas, it is thinking itself.

However, as we said, the more abstract (stylized) a concept, memory, or mental image is, the less we can modify the way it is interpreted, as it is already interpreted when stored as a memory, i.e. it is already connected to a particular interpretation. To reuse the previous example, if we had the idea that a given action is benefitial to us, then any memory of us performing that action would be a happy one (even if we weren't happy all the time that we were doing it), and so, if we are relying on memories, we wouldn't be able to reconcile our stance. This is why so often seeing recordings or other people's stories of past events helps us shift our perception of them, better than memories.

Moreover, (as we also said), mental images reinforce themselves with memories. That means that if the better part of our memories are is recorded with a particular interpretation, then, this interpretation will, with time, occupy the rest of our consciousness. For this reason, it makes sense to talk about _the default interpretation_ that a given person sees the world through --- the one that connects all our experiences into a coherent whole, the one which we never question, as it pretty much is us. 

This default interpretation is deeply connected with the concept of the self.
