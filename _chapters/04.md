On the ability to memorize and on the way our thinking becomes more and more dogmatic over time as a contributing factor of our notion of time. On the self-enforcement of deterministic subsystems, due to mental images and goals which are mistaken for the actual world.
===

Practitioners of mnemonics have long realized that the easiest way to remember a bunch of unconnected pieces of information is to make up some connections between them. This is because our brain cannot capture raw perception data - it can only  capture mental images and causal connections - we only remember events that are connected with one another.

```
0. Because we necessarily see them as connected, all events that we remember form a structure that is known as a causal chain.
```

An event that has nothing to do with our causal chain is simply not perceived by us (or, it is perceived but not remembered even for a second). So in many ways, placing the event in the causal chain is perception itself.

Furthermore, events that are part of the causal chain can be *compressed* further, by imposing additional structure - e.g. if I just remember that I went to school yesterday, I don't have to remember going out of the house, locking the door, waiting for the bus etc. as all this is implicit (some computer compression algorithms are based on the same principle). This compression process is repeated more and more times as our memories become older (e.g. in 10 years you wouldn't remember every day you spent at school, you'd just have some very abstract image of the time you spent there).

```
1. Because of the way that memories work, mental images have the power to reinforce themselves with time - having the image of `A â‡’  B` in our head, we would see `A`-s and `B`-s all over the place. 
```

Aside from their degree of abstraction, mental images also have a degree of realness. In our everyday thinking, we often refer to all things that we talk about as either real or unreal (just like in logic we split statements to true and false) e.g. Stephen Hawking is real and Professor Charles Francis Xavier is not - an event is either in the chain or not. This line of thought, however is too naive. To see why, one just has to look at a more abstract concept, e.g. is true love real, and does it exist? It all depends on how you define it, and defining it in too robust terms is impossible, as the definition would rely on many other concepts. the "realness" of a concept is not just a matter of whether something exist or does not i.e. if you had or had not seen something that resembles it, but a matter of how much does the concept you assign to the perception resonates with the concepts that constitute our worldview. Changing these concepts would then change our whole experience not only of the present, but also of the past.

```
2. The causality chain is modifiable and past events that we remember are mere projections of the mental images that we use at this instant, as unstable and as subjective to change as our future projections.
```

However, because we remember images, and not raw perception data, we cannot modify our perception of past events, and the more distant an event is the more "stylized" it is i.e. connected with the mental images that we had used when we perceived it. Because of this, we cannot really use our memories to make any *new* mental images, but only to extrapolate on the images that we already have. This is why older people are always more dogmatic that younger ones - we accumulate more mental images with time and therefore perceive less, the only way to prevent that is to not have memories at all.

```
3. As it goes farther and farther from the "now", each moment the more compressed it becomes and more "stylized" (replacing more and more perception data with mental images). 
```

One of the biggest biases of our perception of time, that we already talked about, is our inability to differentiate between the mental images representing the world (`M`) and `W`, the world itself, resulting in us thinking that our perceptions represent a state of the affairs whereas they are merely a record of our mental images. Memories are probably the chief reason for this bias, as they can multiply it indefinitely: the moment we perceive a given "frame" the memory of it is super rich and full of detail and of empirical data, which can be further analyzed and interpreted. But as soon as we perceive the next frame, many aspects of the previous one are compressed, leaving only those that provide context for it (the next frame). Then when a third frame is perceived the two that we already have are packaged together again, leaving only the aspects that are useful for it's perception, only *there isn't a way to actually know which aspects would be really useful for providing a context in the future*. This process continues *ad infinitum*.

We naively think of our memories as true representation of reality because they "work" i.e. have good success rate at predicting future events, but just because we are able to exploit a given model for our benefit does not mean that we understand it.
