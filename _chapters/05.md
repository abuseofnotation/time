# The Real World and the Self: Deconstructing Identity and Choice

_On the Real World and the Self_

When the roman emperor Julius Caesar crossed the river Rubicon and entered enemy territory, he famously declared, "The die has been cast." This phrase implied that from that moment onward, battle was the only option, and in this sense, its outcome had been predetermined (I believe (though I’ve never seen anyone else claim it) that the die he referred to belonged to the Greek/Roman deity Decuma/Lachesis—one of the three Fates, who, according to myth, determined the course of each person’s life by casting a die). While I might be wrong about the reference, the phrase nevertheless serves as a fitting illustration of the Greco-Roman view of fate as a destiny — predetermined and immutable, like a thread through which we are all bound to travel (another image drawn from the myth of the three Fates).

But that view is nonsense. Fate isn’t predetermined. At any moment, Caesar could have chosen to retreat, surrender, spend the day fishing in the Rubicon, or pursue a thousand other things instead of, or in parallel with fighting. The reason Julius Caesar didn’t see any of those options is that he wouldn’t be Julius Caesar if he chose any of them — meaning they wouldn’t fit the narrative that is himself.

In much the same way, each of us has countless options that could dramatically alter our fate. Yet we rarely consider the vast majority of them simply because we feel that choosing them would make us lose our identity.

The idea of the self, like identity in general, is a personification of what is knowable — your persona, your job, the things you know and believe — these make up who you are. Any habit, thought, or urge that falls outside this narrative isn’t truly part of the self. And this isn’t because such habits/thoughts/urges are rare, better, worse, or in any way different from the rest of your habits/thoughts/urges. They aren’t part of the self precisely because they aren’t part of the narrative.

> 0.  The self is not who you are, but who you want to be — your projected goal.

We spoke how the concept of God is a personification of the aspect of reality that doesn’t adhere to the principle of causality and remains unknowable. Religious rituals can be rationalized with the following argument: although we can’t truly understand the unknowable aspects of reality, we must pay tribute to them so as not to forget their existence. In this respect, the greatest mistake of these rituals, and of religion as a whole, is that they anthropomorphize (or personify) the unknown by assigning a self to it—God.

The idea of the human self has certain similarities to that of God and is flawed for the same reasons.

All conflicts within ourselves are essentially conflicts between different types of goals, each of which entails different mental images. For instance, believing that `A ⇒ B` and perceiving the world in terms of A’s and B’s implies one role for us, while believing that `X ⇒ Y` and perceiving the world in terms of X’s and Y’s implies a different role. The common characteristic of these views is that they both necessitate _a_ role, as they wouldn’t exist otherwise. In this sense, we might say that there isn’t one `M`, but many `M`’s, all interconnected.

To see the origin of the idea of causality, we need to look nor further than within ourselves. In fact, the concept of oneself is just a treatment of the concept of causality.

## Roles

We are defined by what we identify with. When we identify with an idea or dogma, our sense of self is tied to its validity—meaning, if the idea is proven wrong, our identity feels threatened. This is why the self-concept clings so tightly to its beliefs: unlike ordinary, empirical ideas that can be weakened by the discomfort of being proven wrong, the concept of the self resists this challenge.

> 1. The idea of the self shapes all other ideas.

Unlike other ideas, abandoning the concept of the self causes pain. Thus, the self is a constructed fiction — a role we play, like actors on a stage.

Consider Julius Caesar. Though history remembers him as a great Roman emperor, a victorious general, and a figure of immense power, he was also, perhaps, a failed poet, an average swimmer, or a person with chronic back pain—a person not so different from you.

Comparing yourself to Julius Caesar may seem absurd, but remember that the image of Julius Caesar we hold is, in many ways, a fiction. So how is being "you" any less of a fiction? It isn't, really. However, when you act as yourself, at least you avoid confusing others about who you are.

Moreover, you can't avoid playing a role. Even if you refuse to play roles, that itself becomes your role.

The most absurd thing is to take your role too seriously—to believe that the "you" others perceive is the real "you" and to cling to that identity even after it has outlived its usefulness. Sometimes, roles have a purpose. In collaborative efforts, for example, it's helpful for everyone to know their parts. That's when roles work.

By playing your role with good timing and without unnecessary intensity, you acknowledge that roles are not something to be taken too seriously.
