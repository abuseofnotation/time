# Conclusions

The ideas outlined here have far-reaching implications, but attempting to synthesize them into prescriptive rules for living would not do them justice. It would merely reduce them to yet another doctrine, which is precisely what we’ve sought to avoid. However, I won’t leave you completely in the dark. Here are some conclusions I’ve personally drawn for the illusion that is myself:

- Don't become overly attached to specific interpretations of reality. Practice empirical thinking, keeping your mind open to new evidence and perspectives.
- Don't worry about making mistakes—anything worth doing is worth doing poorly.
- Compare things in terms of quality, not quantity. Acquiring more possessions won’t bring happiness, just as living longer won’t lead to immortality.
- If you’re feeling sad, it might be because you’re thinking of yourself too much. Shifting your focus outward can often provide relief.
