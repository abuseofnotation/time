# Appendix 2: The table of `M` and `W`

|                        | `M`                     | `W`            |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------- |
| **Kantian equivalent** | World as we perceive it | World as it is |
| **Characteristic**     | Fragmented              | Unified \*     |
| **Mode of perception** | Dogmatic                | Empirical      |
| **Defined by**         | Causality               | Entropy        |
| **Time structure**     | Chain                   | Graph          |

- `M` is unified in a sense, as it obeys common principles. However, `W` is unified on a much deeper levelâ€”where chaos and lack of structure make everything interconnected. Meanwhile, our mental world (`M`) is fragmented, allowing us to isolate and view specific parts independently.
