On not caring as means of regaining our sanity and on the lack of goal as a goal.
===

- Perception of time as a fractal 
- The lack of ideology as ideology.
- On mistakes
- On problems

Mediocre is an action which was created with a clear goal in mind.
Great/stupid, is an action which was created with a lack of a goal.


God and self
---

The idea of God is not merely delusion created to help cope with the fear of death (although it does help people cope with the fear of death), but it is a personification to the aspect of reality that does not adhere to the causality maxim and that is unknowable. Religious rituals can be rationalized using the following argument: although we cannot really be familiar with the aspect of reality which is unknowable, we must pay tribute to it, in order not to forget of its existence.

The idea of the self is probably closer to a delusion than that of God, but it is a personification of that which is knowable - your persona, your job, the things you know and believe are you. Any habit thought or urge that is outside of this narrative is not really a part of the self. And that is not because such habits/thoughts/urges are rare. Neither because they are better, worse or in any way different than the rest of your habits/thoughts/urges. They are not part of the self for precisely that reason - they are not a part the narrative.

The self is not who you are, but who you want to be (your projected goal).
